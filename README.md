# AC-Explorer
A file explorer and exporter for the Assassin's Creed Unity's forge file format. Written in python 3.7

Donations are welcome: https://www.paypal.me/gentlegiantJGC

Some of the code accessing the raw data is based on a program called ARchive_neXt which can be found here : http://www.tbotr.net

This code was ported to python at which point further features were added. The internal systems of this program have been written from scratch.

The main aim of this project is to be able to export whole sections of the world correctly pieced together.

The long term goal is to include other games that use the forge file storage system but currently the goal is to be able to export the world models from AC Unity.
